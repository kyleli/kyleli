# Hey, I'm Kyle Li!

I'm a developer and marketer who's been dabbling in open source, startup projects, and games since 2012. I've worked on a variety of exciting projects, from founding and managing international game development teams to leading marketing initiatives for innovative startups. My toolkit includes Python, C#, HTML, CSS, JS, Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Blender, and After Effects.

### Currently, I'm building **Hydrift**! 🚀

Hydrift is a sci-fi action RPG where you pilot a tiny emergency vessel on an alien water world—think resource management, epic decisions, and a splash of adventure! 🌊🛠️ You'll navigate the waters, make tough choices, and discover what it truly means to adapt (or exploit) the world around you.

Dive into my repos and let's make waves together!
